# Simple-Elements
Simple GUI elements for Khan Academy. This GUI library was made to be simple and easy to use. It doesn’t offer a huge selection of elements as of now, but the number will increase in the future. You can view the program on Khan Academy [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/ps-elements/4892508239003648).

## Built With

- Suggested a better way of defining methods
- Suggested to store all elements in an array and iterate over each element to deliver the event
- Suggested to use a `virtual` `noop` function in case a method that is not defined is invoked
